# pleasant

A long time ago a friend of mine pointed out that a common name I use (jakeman)
is relatively pleasant to type. "Jakeman" ping-pongs back and forth across
a qwerty keyboard. Out of curiosity, I tossed together some python to figure
out all such words.

I've trimmed the list of words less than 4 characters, and sorted them in
order. I also wrote a litle thing that looks for "one-handed" words because
I noticed that sweater is pleasant to type as well.

## usage

Run pleasant.py under python3. It takes dictionaries as arguments.

```
python3 pleasant.py /usr/share/dict/words
```
